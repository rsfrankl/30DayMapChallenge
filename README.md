# 30DayMapChallenge

Preserving for posterity my maps for the 20% of the 2020 30 Day Map Challenge I took part in. Next year I'll aim for all 30; this was good fun. Highly recommended.

## Day 3 – Polygons
Hand-curated county map of the US with a very important message for early November 2020. Basically, I manually selecte the counties I wanted, in order to spell "vote". Not too sophisticated.

## Day 12 – Map (very much) Not Made With GIS Software
Self-explanatory map of the US made from cheese puffs. My apologies to the upper peninsula of Michigan. I tried, I really did.

## Day 19 – Null
US Geography programs that have awarded PhDs to *only* men or *only* women between 2010–2019. The underlying story, of course, is around gender balance in US Geography PhD production. Every program awarded degrees to a mix of males and females, but there's a preponderance of programs that awarded more than half of PhDs during this period to males (e.g., proportion greater than 0.50). An important caveat here is that we don't observe those who started, but did not complete, a PhD. Data come from the IPEDS database: PhDs conferred in "Geography and Cartography".

#### During this period, the biggest programs in terms of awarded PhDs were:
1. UCSB (by far)
2. Texas State
3. UMD College Park
4. UC Boulder
5. University of Arizona and Louisiana State (tied)

#### Geography Programs with the largest proportions of PhDs awarded to women were:
1. University of Delaware
2. University of Oregon
3. University of Maryland Baltimore COunty
4. University of Washington
5. Rutgers

#### Geography Programs with the largest proportions of PhDs awarded to men were:
1. Indiana State
2. Northern Illinois
3. University of Connecticut and Oklahoma State (tied)
4. Kent State
5. University of Iowa

## Day 20 – Population
Population map. Shoe population, that is. Maps based on the complete decennial shoe census I conducted in April 2020. All shoes reside at only two addresses, but for fun I masked their exact location. It's a census, after all, and privacy is paramount. Data are here.

### Vermont Annex
After the fact, I realized I'd failed to count a small subshare of shoes. Undercount was rectified and an additional map provided.

## Day 28 – Non-Geographic Map
In fairness, this is a geographic non-map, but who's counting. Notably, I made this in Powerpoint, like a pro. The "map" shows all the states and countries I've lived in so far, in order. I do not account for duration of stay in any location, but these were actual moves: permanant and at least a year in length.

## Day 30 – Map
Documenting my Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) in August 2020, during a brief respite from the pandemic. The TMB is a circuit hike around Mont Blanc and passes through France, Italy, and Switzerland, before ending back in France. It traditionally starts and ends in Les Houches, not far from Chamonix. As you can see, some days covered much more distance than others. Looks can be deceiving! On many of these days, the ascents were **hard** even if the overall distance wasn't much.
